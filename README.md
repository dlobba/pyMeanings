# pyMeanings

pyMeanings is a very small tool that uses PyDictionary and html2text
to make an rst document containing definitions of all words contained in an html file
(a common format for epub books).

This has been done as a small personal project, to keep myself trained in Python3
and to be able to read english books without having to desperately search for terms on
the dictionary every now and then.

You are free to use it as you want, the software is provided **as** **is** without guarantee.

The program is far from complete, but still it is quite useful.

Once you have the rst text use rst tools to convert it to html or to PDF.
